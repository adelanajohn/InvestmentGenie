# The InvestmentGenie Generative AI App ‚≠êÔ∏è

I‚Äôm excited to share a project that automates financial planning and investment services using generative AI. This project demonstrates the significant impact of well-crafted prompts on AI-generated content, highlighting the importance of prompt engineering in maximizing the potential of generative AI systems.

## 1. What is the InvestmentGenie App ü§∑?
The InvestmentGenie app is a [wealth management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealthmanagement.asp) service that uses generative AI to create investment portfolios. It makes use of the asset allocation strategy, which is the process of dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories, like stocks and bonds.

In this post, we focus on how to create a generative AI app that offers tailored personalized investment recommendations based on the lifestyle and preferences of users.

## 2. Prompt Engineering üèóÔ∏è
Prompt engineering is a crucial skill in working with generative AI models. It involves crafting effective inputs (prompts) to guide AI models in producing desired outputs. 

Prompt engineering techniques include zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and ReAct (reasoning and acting). This app makes use of the few-shot prompting technique, which provides a few examples of the task before asking the model to perform it.

## 3. Solution Overview üõ†Ô∏è
The following figure shows the architecture of the InvestmentGenie app.

![Architecture diagram](images/architecture.png)

Users are able to configure the following input parameters on the app:
- Name
- Age
- Risk appetite
- Retirement age
- Amount to invest
- Marital status
- Number of kids

The personalized recommendations offered by the app includes sections such as:
- Personal details
- Recommendation summary
- Investment recommendation details (allocation, allocation amount, reason for recommendation)
- Allocation charts
- Additional notes
- Learning resources.

### 3.1 Model Selection
A selection of models was reviewed, with consideration for use cases, model attributes, maximum tokens, cost, accuracy, performance, and supported languages. Based on this, Anthropic Claude-3 Sonnet was selected as best suited for this use case, as it strikes a balance between intelligence and speed, and it optimizes on speed and cost.

### 3.2 Prerequisites

You first need to set up an AWS account and configure your [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam) (IAM) permissions correctly. You then need to install [Boto3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pythonsdk) and the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli). You also need to [request](https://catalog.workshops.aws/building-with-amazon-bedrock/en-US/prerequisites/bedrock-setup) Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet model access on [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock). You can find the code samples in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/adelanajohn/InvestmentGenie).

This app utilizes the following patterns:
- Packages: For a hierarchical structuring of the module namespace.
- Application factory: An application factory in [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) is a design pattern useful in scaling Flask projects. It helps in creating and configuring Flask projects flexibly and efficiently, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain as it grows and evolves.
- Blueprints: Blueprints are a way to organize Flask applications into reusable and maintainable units.
- Templates: Templates are files that contain static data as well as placeholders for dynamic data. A template is rendered with specific data to produce a final document. This app makes use of the [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) template engine.

#### Python virtual environment setup
Establish a [Python venv module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) virtual environment in the project directory and then proceed to install all necessary dependencies. By using a project-specific virtual environment, you ensure that all dependencies are installed exclusively within that environment, rather than system-wide.

Windows PowerShell
```shell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

macOS
```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see a parenthesized **(venv)** in front of the prompt after running the command, which indicates that you‚Äôve successfully activated the virtual environment.

#### Add dependencies
Once you have activated your virtual environment, proceed with installing Flask.

```shell
python -m pip install Flask
```

#### Install requirements
```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Configure AWS CLI options
Next, configure AWS CLI options. If this command is run with no arguments, you will be prompted for configuration values such as your AWS Access Key Id and your AWS Secret Access Key.
```shell
aws configure
```

```shell
AWS Access Key ID [****]:
AWS Secret Access Key [****]:
Default region name [us-east-1]: us-east -1
Default output format [json]: json
```

#### Run the Flask project

Windows PowerShell
```shell
python -m flask --app InvestmentGeniePackage run --port 8000 --debug
```

macOS
```shell
export FLASK_APP=InvestmentGeniePackage
python -m flask ‚Äîapp InvestmentGeniePackage run ‚Äîport 8000 ‚Äîdebug
```

#### Quit the app
Press CTRL+C or ^C on the terminal. 

#### Exit the Python virtual environment
```shell
deactivate
```

### 3.3 Building the application

#### Application factory (/InvestmentGeniePackage/__init__.py)
Application Factory is a function that is responsible for creating the application object and its configuration.

```python
from flask import Flask

from InvestmentGeniePackage import (
    errors,
    pages
)

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.secret_key = 'w4&L#3$Qc5@g'

    app.register_blueprint(pages.bp)
    app.register_error_handler(404, errors.page_not_found)
    return app
```

#### Blueprints (/InvestmentGeniePackage/pages.py)
Blueprints are modular components in Flask that encapsulate a collection of related views. They can be easily imported in the init file, providing a convenient way to organize and structure the application's routes and functionality.

```python
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, redirect, request, session, url_for
from json2html import *
import boto3
import json

bp = Blueprint("pages", __name__)

# Home page
@bp.route("/", methods=("GET", "POST"))
def home():
    session['quizFlag']="1"
    if request.method == "POST":
        return redirect(url_for("pages.recommendations"))
        
    return render_template("pages/home.html")

# Recommendations page
@bp.route("/recommendations", methods=("GET", "POST"))
def recommendations():
    if request.method == "POST":
        name=request.form.get('Name')
        age=request.form.get('Age')
        risk_appetite=request.form.get('RiskAppetite')
        retirement_age=request.form.get('RetirementAge')
        amount_to_invest=request.form.get('AmountToInvest')
        marital_status=request.form.get('MaritalStatus')
        number_of_kids=request.form.get('NumberOfKids')
        
        jsonResponse=get_response(name, age, risk_appetite, retirement_age, amount_to_invest, marital_status, number_of_kids) # Call LLM

        # Extract JSON response
        startPosition = jsonResponse.index("{")
        endPosition = jsonResponse.rindex("}")
        json_response = jsonResponse[startPosition:endPosition+1]
                
        # Convert JSON data to a Python object 
        data = json.loads(json_response) 

        _name = data["name"]
        _age = data["age"]
        _risk_appetite = data["risk_appetite"]

        _marital_status = data["marital_status"]
        _number_of_kids = data["number_of_kids"]
        _summary = data["summary"]
        _additional_note = data["additional_note"]
        _investment_advice = data["investment_advice"]
        _resources = data["resources"]

        chart_x_values = []
        chart_y_values = []
        
        # Loop through the top-level _investment_advice keys
        for category, details in _investment_advice.items():
            chart_x_values.append(category)
            chart_y_values.append(details.get('allocation_amount'))
            
        _investment_advice_table = json2html.convert(json=_investment_advice, table_attributes="class='table'")
        _resources_table = json2html.convert(json=_resources, table_attributes="class='table'")

        return render_template("pages/result.html", json_response=json_response, _name=_name, _age=_age, _risk_appetite=_risk_appetite, _retirement_age=_retirement_age, _amount_to_invest=_amount_to_invest, _marital_status=_marital_status, _number_of_kids=_number_of_kids, _investment_advice_table=_investment_advice_table, _summary=_summary, _additional_note=_additional_note, _resources_table=_resources_table, chart_x_values=chart_x_values, chart_y_values=chart_y_values)
        
    else:
        return render_template("pages/home.html")        
    
    return render_template("pages/recommendations.html")
